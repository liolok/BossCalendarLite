Calculate and remember when bosses respawn, with click-announcing and auto-reminding.

By default, press and hold "V" to view the calendar.

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]
This is a client-only mod, it only works if you're there when the boss is defeat.

[h3]Loot Stash[/h3]
Only works for gold chain version during Winter's Feast.
Timer starts when Klaus is defeat, earlier than Loot Stash being opened.

[h3]Malbatross[/h3]
By default world settings, it respawns after 5~15 days.
We take it as 15.

[h3]Terrarium[/h3]
Once the twins have been summoned at least once, if a single night is spent without summoning them again, the Terrarium immediately enters its dormant state.
We are not detecting this situation.

[h3]Nightmare Werepig / Scrappy Werepig[/h3]
At the moment of next day coming, if the defeated variant is still existing in another player's sight, respawn will delay a whole day.
We have no way to detect this situation.

[h3]Frostjaw[/h3]
Timer only starts when trading with it, earlier than its actual despawn.
